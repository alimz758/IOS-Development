This is quiz app, that has 13 questions. This is the first time that I implemeted MVC Design. I used PrgoressHUD, https://github.com/relatedcode/ProgressHUD,

You can simply change the questions from the QuestionBank class and add more/less questions.

Becarefull, you need to change the limit of the number of questions in ViewController.swift as I manually hard-coded it.
