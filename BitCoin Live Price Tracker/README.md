This is a Bit-Coin Live Price tracker that gets data from  apiv2.bitcoinaverage.com

I use Cocoapod, Alamofire and SwifyJSON, to do a get http request and to pasrse the JSON file.

You need to install the aformentioned pod files to code such an application. You can read instructor on how to install 

those pods from the README of the Weather-App in this Repo. 

Note: I did not make the image assets.
